🚀 Sales Dashboard | FY 2025 | Turning Data into Strategic Decisions

Excited to share one of my recent analytical dashboards focused on Sales, Cost & Profit Performance (FY 2025).

This dashboard is not just visualization — it is decision intelligence.

🔎 Key Business Insights:

✅ Total Sales: 3M
✅ Total Cost: 2M
✅ Net Profit: 998K (~33% profitability margin)
✅ Production vs Sold Qty: 76K vs 52K (Inventory Optimization Opportunity)

📊 Analytical Observations:

• Product D leads revenue contribution (0.65M sales) but cost structure suggests margin optimization scope.
• Production exceeds sales volume → Working capital & inventory holding cost impact.
• Profit distribution across products indicates opportunity for pricing strategy refinement.
• Day-wise & manager-wise slicers enable leadership-level drilldowns for accountability tracking.

💡 Business Questions This Dashboard Answers:

Which products drive maximum profitability vs revenue?

Where are we over-producing vs under-selling?

How can pricing strategy improve gross margin?

Which sales manager contributes highest revenue impact?

How does cost behavior vary across product categories?
