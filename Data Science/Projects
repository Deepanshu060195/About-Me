## Executive Summary
This project focuses on <span style="color:Blue; font-size:1em; font-weight:bold">detecting fraudulent mobile financial transactions using a time-aware, behavior-driven machine learning approach.</span>
Fraud detection is treated as a cost-sensitive classification problem, where the objective is to <span style="color:Blue; font-size:1em; font-weight:bold">minimize financial losses</span> caused by fraudulent transactions while balancing customer experience.

This project aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting fraud in mobile financial transactions. By leveraging machine learning, the project seeks to predict fraudulent transactions with high precision. 

<span style="color:Blue; font-size:1em; font-weight:bold">The goal is to develop a robust machine learning model to accurately identify fraudulent transactions in real-time , enabling the company to improve security, reduce financial losses, and gain insights into factors contributing to transaction fraud.</span>

The analysis follows as below workflow:
- Understanding fraud behavior over time
- Identifying transaction patterns and account-level risks
- Engineering behavioral features
- Building and evaluating machine learning models
- Quantifying financial impact and operational trade-offs

Financial fraud leads to direct monetary losses, reputational damage, and customer dissatisfaction. 
In mobile money systems, fraud often occurs through account takeovers followed by rapid fund transfers and cash-outs.

### Key Challenges:
-  <span style="color:Red; font-size:1em; font-weight:bold">Severe class imbalance (fraud is rare)
-  <span style="color:Red; font-size:1em; font-weight:bold">High cost of missed fraud (False Negatives)
-  <span style="color:Red; font-size:1em; font-weight:bold">Customer friction due to incorrect blocking (False Positives)

Therefore, this problem is framed as a **cost-sensitive classification problem**, not an accuracy optimization problem.

## Analysis Roadmap

 <span style="color:Blue; font-size:1em; font-weight:bold">This project follows a structured, industry-style workflow to understand, model, and evaluate fraudulent transactions in a mobile financial system.  
The analysis is designed to mirror how fraud analytics teams investigate, detect, and mitigate financial fraud in real-world environments.

### 1. Business Understanding & Risk Framing
- Define fraud in the context of mobile financial transactions
- Understand business impact of fraud and model errors
- Frame the problem as a cost-sensitive classification task

### 2. Data Overview & Integrity Checks
- Review dataset structure and feature definitions
- Validate data quality and balance consistency
- Identify potential data anomalies relevant to fraud detection

### 3. Time-Based Transaction Analysis
-  <span style="color:Red; font-size:1em; font-weight:bold">Analyze transaction volume and fraud occurrence over time (hourly steps)
- Identify temporal patterns and high-risk time windows
- Understand fraud clustering behavior

### 4. Transaction Type & Fraud Strategy Analysis
- Examine fraud distribution across transaction types
- Identify common fraud flows (e.g., TRANSFER followed by CASH_OUT)
- Understand operational fraud patterns

### 5. Amount & Balance Behavior Analysis
- Compare transaction amount distributions for fraud and non-fraud
- Detect account draining behavior and balance depletion patterns
- Identify abnormal monetary movements

### 6. Entity-Level Risk Analysis
- Analyze origin accounts to identify abnormal transaction velocity
- Examine destination accounts for potential money mule behavior
- Understand network-level fraud concentration

### 7. Feature Engineering
-  <span style="color:Blue; font-size:1em; font-weight:bold">Create time-based and behavioral features (velocity, balance ratios, time gaps)
- Encode categorical variables appropriately
- Prepare model-ready feature sets

### 8. Model Development & Evaluation
- Build and compare multiple classification models
- Address class imbalance and threshold selection
-  <span style="color:Blue; font-size:1em; font-weight:bold">Evaluate models using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

### 9. Financial Impact Analysis
- Quantify expected losses due to false positives and false negatives
- Estimate fraud loss reduction achieved by the model
- Assess business value of the fraud detection system

### 10. Real-World Considerations & Add-On Analyses
- Analyze fraud pattern drift over time
- Evaluate alert volume vs fraud capture trade-offs
- Assess customer experience impact
- Compare rule-based, ML-based, and hybrid detection approaches

### 11. Conclusions & Recommendations
- Summarize key fraud insights and risk drivers
- Recommend deployment and monitoring strategies
- Outline next steps for improving fraud detection performance
